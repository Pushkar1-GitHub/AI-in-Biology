    "## 1. Why Feature Scaling Is Needed in Molecular Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In drug discovery, molecules are converted into numbers called **molecular descriptors** such as Molecular Weight (MW), LogP (lipophilicity), TPSA, and many others. Machine learning models do not understand chemistry; they only see numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each molecule becomes a **point in mathematical space**. For two descriptors like MW and LogP, every molecule is a point on a 2D graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "- X-axis → Molecular Weight\n",
    "- Y-axis → LogP\n",
    "\n",
    "The ML model learns patterns purely from distances and positions of these points."

    "- MW: 200–400 Daltons\n",
    "- LogP: 2–6 (unitless)\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerically, MW values are much larger. As a result, distance calculations become dominated by MW even if LogP is chemically crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **mathematical bias**, not a chemical one. Feature scaling exists to correct this imbalance while preserving molecular relationships."

    "- Indicates how hydrophobic a molecule is\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Why LogP Matters\n",
    "- Low LogP → poor membrane permeability\n",
    "- Very high LogP → poor solubility and toxicity risk\n",
    "- Most oral drugs fall between LogP 1 and 5\n",
