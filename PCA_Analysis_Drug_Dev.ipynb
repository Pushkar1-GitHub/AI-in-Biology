    "\n",
    "In high-dimensional biological data, many features are correlated. Variance measures how spread out data points are around their mean. Covariance measures how features vary together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geometric intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA rotates the coordinate system to align with directions of maximum variance. These directions correspond to eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and represent the most informative axes of variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drug development relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "Omics datasets often contain thousands of variables but few samples. PCA helps separate signal from noise and identify dominant biological processes before downstream biomarker analysis."
